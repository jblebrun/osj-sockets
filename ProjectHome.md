This project provides a sockets interface for webOS developers to use. It relies on a custom service being installed, so apps created with this service won't be submittable to the Palm app catalog, but they can be made available through the homebrew catalog.

In addition to the Java-based backend service, a JavaScript object is provided that makes the service easier to use.
